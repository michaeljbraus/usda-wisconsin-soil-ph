Hello, 

This box has two sets of soil samples, both of which are to be processed and analyzed in the same way but must be billed at different times. 


ALL SAMPLES: Sample preparation, then (1) Routine Analysis, (2) Cation Exchange Capacity Analysis, & (3) Total N and Organic Carbon Analyses. 


Both sample sets will be billed on the same funding stream but at different times. 

SAMPLE SET 1: Please bill Sample Set 1 (Bags 1 to 47) immediately, or before September 30th, 2018. 

SAMPLE SET 2: Please bill Sample Set 2 (Bags 48 to 65) after September 30th, 2018. 


Thank you for accommodating our specific needs and generally providing the necessary and adroit service of soils testing to UW-Madison researchers and many others! 


Kindest regards,
