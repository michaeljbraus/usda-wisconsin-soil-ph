Hope your samples are working out for your project.

I had sampled the plot treatments for the standard soil test (o.m., pH, P & K) the day before you came to sample.

Attached are the results from the Marshfield Soil Testing Lab. 

I thought they may be of interest. 

 

Last fall the soil tests were all low so Carrie Laboski figured how much pell lime to apply and I had applied pell lime this spring.

It appears that the pell lime worked fast and was too much. 

We still have a range of soil pH’s but just not the target ones. 

Not sure if you are doing any pH tests in conjunction with your cores. 

I would be curious if your results are similar.

Additionally in mid November, I sampled the pH plot at the Marshfield Station.

The was not managed for pH in the last several years. 

I have not looked closely to compare measured pH vs. target pH but there is a range of soil pH’s.

I will get a chance to do that later today.

Being there is a range of soil pH’s it may be another site for you if you are interested.

The site however is fairly low ground…..surrounded by cattails so it is a wet soil. 

So much so that the last sample core on one end came out “gleyed with concretions” (and I was only coring to 6-7”).
