Here are the Marshfield Ag Research Station pH plot soil test results.

Still a range but not many in the 6â€™s.

As I said earlier this is a relatively low lying field with swamp around it (actually a berm for a pond above the field too). 

So the wetness could affect the microorganisms as much as the pH does.
